## Quickstart
1. `Python 3.6` recommended but tbd, pyaudio and some other stuff might not work.
2. The VSCode linter doesn't seem to like `opencv-python` or `cv2` (just a heads up).

## Speech to text
- `cd <project>`
- `python youtube-extraction.py`

## Smile detection
- `python smile-detection.py`
